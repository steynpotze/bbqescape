					<h2>What is BBQ Escape?</h2>
					<p>
						What do you do when you discover you are about to get grilled on a random family BBQ party? Try to escape of course!
					</p>
					<p>
						You are playing a heavily armed ham who jumps from platform to platform, avoiding and shooting enemies.
						These enemies are evil vegetables who are angry about the fact that more and more people are choosing to eat them instead of meat. They will do everything in their power to stop you from escaping, and will make sure you are the one who is eaten first.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though you always end up on the barbecue, there still is a difference between losing and losing. There is a worldwide high score which every player is trying to beat. Of course, for the less skilled players, you can always just try to beat your own high score.
					</p>
					<p>
						BBQ Escape was developed in 8 weeks time by a team of four first year software engineering students at Saxion University. The game was developed as a project assigned to us by school. The original assignment was to make a 2D single player game using the framework provided by school. However, we thought we could do better by developing our own game engine using OpenGL ES.
						<br>We think we succeeded.
